![Cancer Detection App](https://www.rishabhsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/RSPL_Blog_ML-In-Healthcare-Use-Cases-Benefits_Banner.jpg)

This web application utilizes machine learning models to predict the risk of breast cancer and lung cancer based on user-provided input features. It offers an intuitive interface for users to input relevant information and obtain predictions regarding their cancer risk.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Provides an introduction to the app and its purpose, along with navigation options to access specific cancer prediction sections.
  
- **Breast Cancer Prediction**: Users can input various features related to breast cancer risk factors, such as mean radius, texture, perimeter, and more. Upon submission, the app predicts the likelihood of breast cancer based on the provided data.
  
- **Lung Cancer Prediction**: Similar to the breast cancer prediction section, users can input relevant features related to lung cancer risk factors. The app then predicts the likelihood of lung cancer based on the input data.
